## Plan of attack

[-] Do some exploratory analysis, so you can view any image and it's bounding boxes
[-] Setup fastai datablock api to read train/validation sets.
~~[] Setup how to transform output of CNN into output for submission~~
~~[] See how a simple RNN performs. Don't need online learning, so accuracy over speed.~~
~~[] See where I am, rinse and repeat? Study more FastAI courses, see if I can improve this score~~
[-] Build an initial character recognition network from scratch, on subset
[-] Examine hooks network from scratch, see what is was looking for?
[] Try to build a character recognition network for all chars
[] Build object recognition from subset
[] With small object recognition model, classified boxes, then feed them into small character recognition model
[] Repeat for large model


The strikethroughs are inteded to show what I had PLANNED on doing, but as my learning evolved, so did my understanding
of what I wanted to do next
